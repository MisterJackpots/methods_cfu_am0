# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?

I feel very confident in using the built-in Ruby methods.

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?

Right now, I feel a bit confused on the exercises in final_practice.rb.  I feel
like I wasn't getting the point of lesson, particularly when it comes to
whether arguments are passed or not.  In the final exercise, although I was
able to write a method that I believe satisfied the question, I feel like I
wasn't using the knowledge in the lesson to arrive at the solution.  I had to
Google for a bit to get something close to what I thought was right, and I
don't feel confident in my answers.

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)

I have a TON of questions, but mostly I just want to know more about returns
and arguments.
